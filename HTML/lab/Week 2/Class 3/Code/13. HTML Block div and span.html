Fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. </div>

<div> <span style="color:red">A fish</span> is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. 
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, 
and cartilaginous and bony fish, as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically 
they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods. </div>

<div>Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping 
in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.
The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. 
Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. </div>
<div style="background-color:yellow;color:green;padding:20px;">Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed 
external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) 
became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.
</div>
Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.[1][2] Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,100 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.[3]
