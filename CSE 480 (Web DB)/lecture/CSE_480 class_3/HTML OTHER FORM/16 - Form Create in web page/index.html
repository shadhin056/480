 <h1 align="Center"> East-West University </h1>
East-West University was founded in 1980 with the mission of providing quality, affordable, multi-cultural, and forward-looking 
higher education to Chicago and the world. The institution has grown and prospered over the years, from a noble idea to a significant 
institution of higher learning accommodating nearly 1200 students. The University maintains a unique place among institutions of higher 
learning in Chicago and the region. East-West has repeatedly been cited as having the lowest tuition among private schools in the Chicago area, 
making a higher education with personal attention more accessible. East-West has one of the highest percentages of international students of any 
baccalaureate school in the nation; it is the only majority-minority four year college in the state of Illinois; the faculty and staff is among 
the most diverse of any institution of higher learning in the nation; its graduates have spread throughout the world making a difference; and 
its close-knit, family atmosphere has been successful in helping students to meet the challenges of making it through college to graduation. 
The majority of East-West University students may come from minority communities, but many non-minority students enjoy attending 
East-West University for the unique perspective it provides. Students interested in social work, human resources, community activism, politics, 
urban planning, government, and other disciplines gain great insights, engage in valuable dialog, make lifelong friends, and are welcomed and 
valued at East-West University. 
<br><br>

To attend East-West University is to become an honorary citizen of the world; to discover a rich, diverse and international perspective on possibilities; 
to expand horizons to encompass the globe; and to make lifelong friends from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives.
<br><br>
East-West University is accredited by the “Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association”. Effective June 25, 2015 
it is placed on probation but remains accredited.
