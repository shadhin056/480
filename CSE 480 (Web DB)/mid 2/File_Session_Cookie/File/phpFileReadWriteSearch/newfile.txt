ARRAY
1.	Take Input in array and print
2.	Take Input in array and reverse print the array
3.	Take Input in array and show sum and average of array
4.	Take two dimensional two array as a input and show the summation in output

FUNCTION
Least Challenging
1.	Write a function that receives 5 integers and returns the sum and average of these numbers. Call this function from main() and print the results in main().
2.	A positive integer is entered through the keyboard. Write a function to determine whether the input number is a perfect number or not.
3.	hello
4.		5.		6.	
7.		8.		9.	
10.		11.		12.	
13.	
14.	Write 4 different functions for calculating the area of a triangle, rectangle, square and circle.

Challenging
1.	Write necessary functions for number conversion, e.g., decimal to binary, binary to decimal, decimal to octal, octal to decimal.
2.	Write a recursive function to find the factorial of a given integer.
3.	Write a recursive function to obtain the first 25 numbers of a Fibonacci sequence. In a Fibonacci sequence the sum of two successive terms gives the third term. Following are the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence:
1    1    2    3    5    8    13    21    34    55    89 …
